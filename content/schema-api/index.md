# Schema API

## Summary

This RFC proposes a way to retrieve the schema of a Register via its REST API.


## Motivation

Currently, the Registers REST API doesn't offer any mechanism to know the
schema for a given size of the Register. Although you can get the list of
fields via the `/register` endpoint you need to complement this information
with the Field register.


## Explanation
